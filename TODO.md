# TODO

 - Add accessible ways of resizing and reordering columns using only a keyboard
 - Add an option for editable rows
   - To avoid sacrificing scroll performance by using a keyed each block to display table rows, we need to implement a custom undo/redo handler
 - Add mechanism for loading chunks of data asynchronously so the entire data set does not need to be loaded at once
 - Add ability to affix columns and rows so they remain visible when scrolling horizontally or vertically
